# Planetary Descent Simulator ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ

A Python-based simulation tool to analyze and evaluate the descent of objects with parachutes on Earth and other planets. The program calculates the altitude, velocity, and descent time, considering gravitational forces and parachute deployment. It determines whether a safe landing is achieved or if the parachute "crashes" due to exceeding safe velocity limits.

## Features

- Simulates descent on Earth and custom planets with adjustable gravitational acceleration.
- Tracks altitude, velocity, and time during descent.
- Detects parachute deployment and evaluates its effectiveness.
- Supports real-time evaluation of safe landing criteria.
- Visualizes descent data through plots.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

---

## Customizing for New Planets

- Modify the gravitational acceleration (gravity) in the code to simulate conditions for other planets.
- Evaluate the parachute performance under varying conditions by observing the final velocity and descent time.
